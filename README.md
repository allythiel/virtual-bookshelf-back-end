Virtual Bookshelf Back End

This repository holds the needed back end to run the Virtual Bookshelf Front End, which is a web app for avid book readers. This back end, combined with the Virtual Bookshelf Front End, was created as a way book readers could track their books and find thri next reads for my final capstone project through devCodeCamp.

Technologies used include: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, Joi, Nodemon, Config and Cors.
