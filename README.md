# Virtual Bookshelf Back End

This repository holds the required back end to run the Virtual Bookshelf Front End, which is a web app for avid book readers. When combining this back end with the Virtual Bookshelf Front End, it allows books readers to track their books, as well as find their next book to read. This project was created as a final capstone during my 16 week immersive bootcamp with devCodeCamp. 

In this project, the technologies that were used include:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongoose
- Joi Validation
- Nodemon
- Config
- Cors
